the other does. The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. 
### **Program's function**
1. The computer asks for players' names
2. The computer flips a coin to decide who goes first
3. The computer asks players where they want to place their pieces in turn

## **Challenges Faced**

I originally wanted to make a chess game. However, it took me too long to write so I decided I would make a gomoku game first for the exam project. 
I will finish the chess game later when I have time :D

Another challenge I faced was checking the diagonal rows. It was very difficult. It didn't check all the grids. I solved it, though. 
I tried multiple ways of checking the rows and finally got it right. 
Using online compiler, I tested the nested for loops and printed out the pair of 2D array coordinate to make sure that it tested the right grid. 
Then, I realized it only checked the upper grid. So I changed the numbers and eventually found out the right ones for lower grids as well.
